# FruitNeuron
  This project presents a program that determines a fruit from a photo of five proposed classes: 
- Pineapple
- Orange
- Banana
- Pear
- Gala Apple

  The new_dataset folder contains a dataset of images for training, and the resized_dataset folder contains resized versions of the images (updated during retraining).
 The "For Testing" directory contains ready-made images for testing the training results.

  To run the program - gui.py
  To retrain (if you changed the dataset) - main.py
